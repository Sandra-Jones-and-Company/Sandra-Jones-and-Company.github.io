                                    <p>  When SJandCO was founded the security was invisible to investors and with a few exceptions was comprised of entrepreneurial companies and smaller divisions of publicly traded companies.  The channel was fragmented, the relationships between the channel and manufacture more adversarial then complementary end-user not consulted.  Technology emerging and often more of an art form than an science.  Understanding that there was an opportunity to improve the market, technology and the relationships between all segments of the market SJandCO was founded.  </p>
                                    <p>
Throughout the years the company was called upon by the industry’s leading suppliers, investors, trade shows, associations and new entrants. Each was able to obtain a solution that would allow them to either accelerate their time to market, avoid costly (or even deadly) product errors or improve profitability through information and the understanding of the market needed to succeed. </p>
                                    <p>
Today the market has changed dramatically and so have the services being provided at SJandCO primarily by Charles Durant who’s corporate, legal, financial and industry knowledge help the more sophisticated and complex companies and investors who comprise todays market. </p>
                                    <p>
Although the services have been refined, the goal of helping clients accelerate their profits has never wavered.
