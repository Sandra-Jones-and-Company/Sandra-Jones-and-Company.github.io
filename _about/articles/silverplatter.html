            sophistication and the emergence of large corporate players have 
            made business more difficult for smaller, independent dealers. 
            Dealer programs can help them remain competitive with sales and 
            marketing, administrative, financial, technical and other assistance. </P>

            <p><b><font size="2"><i>By Sandra Jones and Craig F. Leiser</i></font></b> </p>
            <p><font size="2"><img align="right" border="1" height="326" hspace="3" src="images/platter.jpg" vspace="3" width="250">The independent 
            entrepreneurial dealer has been the origin and lifeblood of the 
            security industry for more than 50 years. At any given time during 
            this period, there have been 12,000 to 15,000 reported dealers in 
            the security and alarm business. 
            <p>Due to the ease of entry into the security industry and the 
            relatively low capital requirements, the small and entry-level 
            dealer population has seen an annual recycling of companies 
            approaching 25 percent. Even so, some of these dealers have grown 
            into very large and successful local and regional businesses. 
            <p>As the potential of the security industry has become apparent, 
            larger national companies have entered the market to sell and 
            install products. Dramatic pressures have been created by the entry 
            of very large and well-capitalized utilities (telephone or power) 
            into the industry, including bundling of service offerings to the 
            end user and the relentless acquisition of the regional and 
            nationally recognized companies. 
            <p>However, local and independent dealer-based businesses continue 
            to dominate the electronic security market. Many of these dealers 
            have had difficulty effectively making the transition from an 
            entrepreneurial company to one that can compete against those large 
            and national providers. 
            <p>The independence of the small dealers leaves them in an exposed 
            and tenuous position. Whom do they seek assistance from? Where can 
            they develop financing to compete with the new selling plans from 
            the larger companies? How do they secure consistent and lower-priced 
            product to competitively serve their customers? Can they afford to 
            advertise to the same extent that a large, consumer-based utility or 
            multinational company can? 
            <p>The solution may be to enroll in a dealer program. Such programs, 
            which are becoming more and more prevalent, can keep independent 
            dealers competitive via sales and marketing, administrative, 
            financial and other support services. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Many Companies Offer Valuable Assistance</b> 
            <p>Dealer programs for the security industry, as well as the home 
            automation/entertainment industry market, are offered from a wide 
            array of industry-related businesses, such as monitoring, 
            manufacturing, distributing, financing and other companies. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Dealer Programs Are Available in 3 Forms</b> 
            <p>In general, there are three different types of affiliation 
            programs: franchise; authorized dealer; and associated dealership. 
            Various providers may identify these under other categories, but the 
            differentiation remains the same. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Keep Up With Products Via Technical Support</b> 
            <p>Technical support usually is based on specific or proprietary 
            product lines that the participating dealer has or will have access 
            to. The support may include training at the provider facilities, 
            regional training sessions, or on-site at the dealer premises, 
            depending on the complexity of the product or service. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Marketing Support May Include Ad Materials</b> 
            <p>Sales and marketing support is probably the most critical area 
            for the success of the affiliation relationship. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Administrative Support May Include Billing</b> 
            <p>Administrative services and support may also be offered in a 
            dealer program. Where there are long-term financial relations to be 
            administered between the end user and the provider, or where there 
            must be clear definitions of the services being offered, it is 
            always prudent to utilize a contract that spells it all out. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Additional Support May Involve Networking</b> 
            <p>One of the greatest, but most intangible mechanisms, to develop a 
            dealer organization is through networking. Dealers should be 
            supportive of each other in representing the product or service, 
            even if they may be competitive in geographic presence. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Financial Support Comprised of 4 Kinds</b> 
            <p>Financial services fall into four general categories: leases, 
            loans, conditional loans and purchases. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Make Sure Affiliation Contract Is Reasonable</b> 
            <p>No program can effectively be managed unless there are means to 
            measure and quantify the result of the efforts. Sales results are a 
            necessity regardless of the product or service offered. Market 
            demographics are also a management tool to determine the results of 
            advertising expense or promotional programs. 
            <p>
            <p><b>Programs Breed Success, Growth</b> 
            <p>There is greater strength in the combined efforts of the dealer 
            and the provider than either can reach on their own.
