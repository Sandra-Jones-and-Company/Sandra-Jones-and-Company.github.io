  <meta name="description" content="Here is a list of testimonials submitted by some of our clients: Over the course of the last decade, Dakota Security Systems gained recognition as one of the most successful security integration companies in the country. Consequently, we were continually approached by strategic buyers who were interested in acquiring our company. When the right strategic and cultural fit presented itself, we quickly recognized that selling a company presents challenges and issues that are very different than those we faced in operating the business. Accordingly, we sought the assistance from both legal and accounting experts and a reputable M&amp;A Advisory firm – Sandra Jones and Company (SJandCo). With help from SJandCo and the rest of our deal team, we successfully sold the business to Convergint Technologies in early 2016. Sandra Jones and her team, including Charles Durant, the former President of the GE Security &amp; Life Safety Group, helped us navigate successfully through the sale process and obtain maximum value for the business. With their extensive experience in the security industry and vast network of relationships, we found their services to be exceedingly valuable and well worth the investment.

Moreover, the respect Sandy has earned through her insights into the marketplace, technology knowledge, research expertise, and relationships is well-known among throughout the entire security ecosystem from the smallest alarm dealers to the largest manufacturers, and integrators. But it doesn&#39;t end there.

                <h4>Here is a list of testimonials submitted by some of our clients:</h4>
 

 <br /> <br />
		   &quot;Operational Security Services, Inc., or OSS for short, has filled the electronic security need of our clients since 1972. We are proud that our excellent reputation in the industry has fostered growth and countless opportunities.
		    <br /> <br />
As my brother and business partner Tom was approaching the age of 70, he informed me of his desire to retire. Consequently, we set out to sell OSS to a business that presented the right strategic and cultural fit and would value my ongoing involvement in the business.
		    <br /> <br />
While Tom and I are well suited to running OSS, which we have done successfully for 45 years, we knew we need assistance as selling a company presents challenges and issues that are very different than those we faced in operating the business. Accordingly, we sought the assistance from a reputable M&A Advisory firm — Sandra Jones and Company (SJandCo). With help from SJandCo, we successfully sold the business to Convergint Technologies on May 1, 2017.
		    <br /> <br />
Sandra Jones and her team, including Charles Durant, the former President of the GE Security & Life Safety Group, helped us navigate successfully through the sale process and obtain maximum value for the business. With their extensive experience in the security industry and vast network of relationships, we found their services to be invaluable and well worth the investment.
		    <br /> <br />
I do not hesitate to recommend SJandCo to any security integrator interested in profit development, exit planning or sale of the business.<br /> <br />
Keep Smiling!&quot;

                <br />
                <br />  
			&quot;I would like to thank you for your participation on the Townsend Board of Advisors. Your advice and comments provided much needed insight and context for the decisions we were facing. The value you brought is evident in the success we are currently achieving. <br /> <br />
I joined Townsend Door Hardware and Systems, a Security and Door Hardware distributor and integrator, to lead the company in the changes required to refine the business strategy, grow the business, and improve our Customer Service. Townsend is a division of Martin, Inc, a well-respected 3rd generation family business headquartered in Florence, AL. <br /> <br />
As an experienced leader in the security and door hardware industry, I realized that significant internal changes would be required to revitalize the organization, restructure the operations, and renew the emphasis on sales. Because of the external factors affecting Townsend, and the dynamic market conditions, Martin's Owners and I recruited a Board of Advisors to provide counsel, insight and feedback. Sandra Jones was an easy choice, given her knowledge of the market, and the depth of her experience with companies like ours, undergoing changes and needing improvements in cash flow and long-term value. Her involvement was very beneficial and helped sharpen our focus, so that together, Townsend was able to achieve real, tangible gains. <br /> <br />
I would recommend Sandra in the strongest terms to any Systems Integrator, Door Hardware Distributor or Security and Audio/Video company that is interested in improving their position in the market place, and in developing a strategy that focuses on tangible long-term value growth. <br /> <br />
We are pleased that Sandy joined our Board, and are realizing the benefits as a result. I would be pleased to speak with anyone who wishes to discuss your involvement further.&quot;

     			 &quot;PSA Security Network is the world’s largest electronic security cooperative, owned by the most progressive security integrators throughout North America. Combined, PSA members boast over 300 branch locations, employ nearly 6,000 security industry professionals and are responsible for over $3.5 billion annually in security, fire and life safety installations. 
 <br /> <br />
PSA’s mission is to empower its owners to become the most successful systems integrators in the markets they serve. PSA brings this mission to life by partnering with industry leading product and solution providers, delivering unparalleled education and training programs and by offering a variety of distinctive services that can enhance any company’s operations. 
 <br /> <br />
As the President and CEO of PSA Security Network, I have never hesitated referring our members to Sandra Jones and Company for guidance and advice.  So when we needed assistance with our recently announced acquisitions of USAV and CI Edge, my first call was to Sandy Jones.  
 <br /> <br />
The involvement of Sandy’s associate and former President of the GE Security & Life Safety Group, Charles Durant, in structuring and negotiating aspects of the deal was invaluable.  Acquiring a business requires knowledge and skill sets that differ greatly from my day job of leading PSA Security Network.  Consequently, when dealing with the opportunity to acquire USAV and CI Edge I knew we had to call in outside help.  I can whole-heartedly tell you that it was worth the investment.
 <br /> <br />
I do not hesitate to recommend SJandCo to any security integrator interested in profit development, exit planning, purchasing another business, or sale of the business.&quot;

                Sandra Jones to assist us with our acquisition strategy. In addition to Sandra's deep understanding of the

                Durant, in structuring and negotiating aspects of the deal was invaluable. Acquiring a business requires
                knowledge and skill sets that differ greatly from my day job of leading PSA Security Network. Consequently,
                when dealing with the opportunity to acquire USAV and CI Edge I knew we had to call in outside help. I can
                whole-heartedly tell you that it was worth the investment.
                <br />
                <br /> I do not hesitate to recommend SJandCo to any security integrator interested in profit development, exit
                planning, purchasing another business, or sale of the business.&quot; </p>

                <a name="codeblue"></a>&quot;Sandy Jones was a gift to me. As an owner of a security company, I was new to the security industry.
                She helped me understand the important dynamics going on in the industry, developed logical, reasonable,
                and helpful consulting proposals, and provided resources we did not yet have to execute projects and guide
                me to make important decisions that enhanced the value of our business in a short period of time. I highly
                recommend her services.&quot;

                <a name="virsec"></a>&quot;Sandy Jones recently assisted us with a product and market verification project for our new VirSec
                remote managed security service that we're preparing for a national rollout. Despite our tight timetable,
                she was thoroughly prepared and was instrumental in our strategic decisions. We'd recommend her to anyone
                and we look forward to utilizing her services again as we move forward.&quot;
